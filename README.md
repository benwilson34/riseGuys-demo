# RiseGuys in-browser demo

An in-browser demo of [carykh's Flash game "Rise Guys" aka "Rising Shrinking Rainbow"](https://github.com/carykh/riseGuys) that uses [Ruffle](https://github.com/ruffle-rs/ruffle). It therefore does not require installing a Flash extension or player to play the game.

It has problems but I don't expect I'll maintain this. This is meant for people who want to try the game but are too lazy to download it :)
